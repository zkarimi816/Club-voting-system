# Club voting system

Club Voting System is a java project that maintains the official records of polling result and aims to facilitate club election inside AUAF. The whole system is made in Eclipse IDE using Javafx scene builder to design the User Interface. This system uses MYSQL database as back-end support. The system supports all the features required for the system. This system can be used by all students who wish to take part in decision making of clubs such as choosing their best candidates through a transparent election or candidate themselves for any position.
This system is controlled by the users and an admin. Admin can basically view, count and delete all users, voters and candidatesâ€™ information. In user control, the system has three main pages such as: candidate page, user Page, and results page. Students can enter this system by creating an account. They cannominate themselves by entering the candidate page, then saving, updating and deleting their personal information. Also they can be a voter to vote for other candidates. Finally, through results page, they can view the results of election for each club.
